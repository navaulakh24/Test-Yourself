# Test-Yourself

This project was assigned from UofT's coding bootcamp.

This is a quiz that uses HTMl, CSS, and Javascript to collect user data to determine whether or not the answers to the questions are right or wrong. Seconds are deducted from the time every time a question is answered incorrectly. Users will want to have a highscore that involves the most time left on the clock after the quiz is over. This data the generates a score and appends a page at the end of the results, where you can input your initials and save the data.

## User Story
- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and my score
